#  Dwarf-Debug-Parser
Author: **SmoothHacker**

This is a debug info parser for ELF files that feeds DWARF info into the Binja DebugInfo API.

## Description:
This is a current work-in-progress debug info parser for ELF files. Currently all that is supported is function name and location discovery. Future plans include recovering structs, typedefs, return types, stack variable types, and more.
